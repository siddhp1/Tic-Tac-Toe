# Tic-Tac-Toe

Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe written in C. AI agent is powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Game is played through a terminal user interface. 

This is my first experience with C, and I will soon implement move ordering (killer) heuristic and transition tables to further improve efficiency.
